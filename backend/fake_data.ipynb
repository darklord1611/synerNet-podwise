We explore differences between introverts and extroverts, in-person and text-based emotional communication, and how emotional suppression impacts us.</p><p>We discuss emotional intelligence and describe tools to improve emotional regulation and communication in personal and professional relationships. We also explore the role of emotions in learning, resolving conflicts, and decision-making. We also discuss bullying in kids and adults, both in person and online.

We explain how mineral-based (inorganic) sunscreens differ from chemical (organic) sunscreens, whether sunscreen can minimize premature skin aging, reduce cancer risk, and if there are any health risks associated with sunscreen use.</p><p>We discuss skincare routines to significantly improve skin appearance and how to select skincare products. We discuss how caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and stress impact the skin and describe how nutrition and anti-inflammatory diets can improve skin health. We also discuss the causes and treatments for common skin conditions, including dandruff, acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo.</p><p>Our conversation also covers topics such as the use of retinoids, laser treatments, red-light phototherapy, supplements, and how to best monitor for skin cancer.

We discuss how to evaluate scientific evidence and the validity of different practices aimed at achieving fat loss, muscle strength and hypertrophy, microbiome health, vitality, and longevity.</p><p>We explore many hotly debated topics, including fasting, seed oils, saturated fats, sugar, red meat, artificial/low-calorie sweeteners, and GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic). Additionally, we delve into the timing of protein and carbohydrate intake relative to fasting and exercise, fat loss and sleep, and the benefits of dietary protein and fiber on overall health.</p><p>We also discuss how to accelerate hypertrophy and fat loss, improve strength, whether we need to train to “failure,” how to enhance exercise recovery, and how to manage pain. We cover training before versus after age 50, whether metabolism changes with age, and the connection between muscle health and longevity. We also address why certain behaviors and supplements might work for some people but not others.</p><p>Listeners to this episode will benefit greatly from Layne’s science-based expertise on a wide range of topics, including health, nutrition, and fitness.</p><p>Access the full show notes for this episode at <a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-layne-norton-tools-for-nutrition-fitness\">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href=\"https://drinkag1.com/huberman\">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>Mateina: <a href=\"https://drinkmateina.com/huberman\">https://drinkmateina.com/huberman</a></p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href=\"https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman\">https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>Maui Nui: <a href=\"https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman\">https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href=\"https://drinklmnt.com/huberman\">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Dr. Layne Norton</p><p>00:01:49 Sponsors: Mateina, Eight Sleep, Maui Nui</p><p>00:06:39 Science-Based Evidence, Mechanism vs. Outcome</p><p>00:14:31 Meta-analysis, Methods, Evidence Quality</p><p>00:22:45 Evidence Hierarchy, Randomized Controlled Trials, Cohort Data</p><p>00:33:53 Sponsor: AG1</p><p>00:35:05 “Don’t Turn Your Brain Off”; Protein Synthesis</p><p>00:42:01 Protein Synthesis, Refractory Response; Resistance Training\\xa0\\xa0</p><p>00:46:05 Protein Intake, Intermittent Fasting &amp; Training</p><p>00:54:52 Tool: Total Protein Intake, Distribution &amp; Protein Synthesis</p><p>01:00:25 Muscle Quality, Protein Remodeling, Muscle Growth</p><p>01:05:34 Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>01:06:46 Early vs. Late Time-Restricted Eating; Fasting Blood Glucose &amp; HbA1c</p><p>01:10:30 Carbohydrate Timing, Individual Response, Placebo; Tool: Tracking Diet</p><p>01:19:50 “The Norton Method”; Tool: Consistency</p><p>01:25:16 Resistance &amp; Cardiovascular Training; Competition; Immune System &amp; Rest</p><p>01:33:50 Mind &amp; Body Effects, Stress; Belief Effects</p><p>01:41:30 Training to Failure, Reps in Reserve, Hypertrophy &amp; Strength Training</p><p>01:50:24 Fatigue &amp; Training to Failure, Speed, Strength Training</p><p>01:59:06 Tool: Training After 50, Consistency</p><p>02:09:12 Fat Cells, Diabetes, Exercise</p><p>02:16:50 Metabolism &amp; Age-Related Changes?, Appetite</p><p>02:23:17 Ozempic, Mounjaro, GLP-1 Agonists, Lean Mass, “Food Noise”</p><p>02:33:42 GLP-1 Agonists, Judgement &amp; Obesity</p><p>02:40:19 Sugar, Excess Calories, Body Weight</p><p>02:49:16 Satiety, Sugar &amp; Calorie Budget</p><p>02:54:56 Tool: Individualization, Context &amp; Diet Psychology</p><p>02:57:22 Seed Oils, Butter, Olive Oil</p><p>03:06:56 Red Meat, Carcinogenic?; Simple Diet; Fiber Benefits</p><p>03:13:43 Saturated Fat, Cholesterol; Seed Oils</p><p>03:18:41 Artificial &amp; Low-Calorie Sweeteners, Insulin, Appetite</p><p>03:29:06 Artificial &amp; Low-Calorie Sweeteners, Gut Microbiome; Cancer</p><p>03:37:58 Tools: Training Recovery, Glycogen Replenishment; Stress &amp; Activity</p><p>03:45:56 Collagen Supplementation, Skin &amp; Nails, Whey Protein</p><p>03:57:00 Evidence-Based Approach</p><p>04:01:41 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Follow &amp; Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href=\"https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer\">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>',\n",
