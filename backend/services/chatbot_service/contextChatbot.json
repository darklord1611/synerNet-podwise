First off, let's talk about the infamous funding secured tweet. This is actually different than what it gave me before, which is a bullet point list. Here's more narrative structure. Cybertruck unveiling where he supposedly unbreakable windows. I'm not correct. Which part? Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured And there was a big trial in San Francisco, a big civil trial. And the jury found me not guilty. Unanimous binding of a San Francisco jury. And here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured? I think this is taking things from the press. Yeah, that is not correct. The reason I agreed to the fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct. That was extremely bad behavior by the SEC, corruption, frankly. But if I did not agree to pay the fine, Tesla would have gone bankrupt immediately. ",

Yeah, that's great. So I was just thinking about the Roman Empire, as 1 does. Is that whole meme where, oh guys, I'm thinking about the Roman Empire at least once a day. And half the population is confused whether it's true or not. But more seriously, thinking about the wars going on in the world today. And as you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of Roman society and culture. And it, I think, has been a big part of most empires and dynasties throughout human history. Yeah, they usually came as a result of conquest. I mean, there's some like the Austro-Hungarian Empire where there was just a lot of sort of clever marriages. But fundamentally there's an engine of conquest and they celebrate excellence in warfare. Many of the leaders were excellent generals, that kind of thing. So big picture question, Grok approved. I asked this is a good question to ask. Did you test it, Grok approved? ",
